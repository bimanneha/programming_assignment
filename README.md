#Problem Statement 

Imagine your family owns 10 houses in Berlin. You are interested in some statistics concerning the houses and therefore want to
sort the houses according to different criteria.

Please implement an Angular2+ app w hich outputs three sorted lists in a visually pleasing way:

- A list of all the houses sorted according to their distance to your sisters home in 'Eberswalder Straße 55'. Start with the house
with the lowest distance.

- A list of houses which have more then 5 rooms. Start with the lowest number of rooms.

- A list of houses that you do not have all the data for. Sort them by the street-name.

- Also you want to move into one of your families houses. Your sister lives in the house at Eberswalder Straße 55. You want to
move into the house that is closest to your sisters home, but only if the house has at least 10 rooms and does not cost more than
5.000.000 €. If you don't know the number of rooms, or the value of the house, you do not want to move into the house. Which
house are you going to move in to?
